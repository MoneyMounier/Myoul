place all client modules here

module requirements:
- an appropriate name ending in Client. ie: LoginClient which logs in a user
- a public static method named after the class, (would be Login in the above example), which takes in:
    - required information
    - server address
    - server port
- this message should process input and format the command before sending it to MyoulClient.query(cmd, address, port)
    - the command format is as follows: (full name of server module) (name of function in server module) arg0 arg1 arg2 ...
                                    ie: "LoginServer authorize username password"
- it will receive an object from the server which it must process and return as a string
